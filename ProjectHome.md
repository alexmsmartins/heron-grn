In this project, the main idea was to start from an article called "A genetic model for a heterogeneous network", that resulted from a work by Angela Teresa Gon√ßalves Filimon under the guidance of Professor Ernesto Costa and which describes the Heron models.
The objectives of this project were the following. First of all, it was intended to re-implement tool written in C++ by Angela Goncalves, but now in python. It was also intended to broaden the scope of the study of GRNs obtained by focusing not only the degree of the nodes of the graph but in other aspects of topology such as clustering coefficient, the average minimum distance from each node, etc. With these topological data we sought to understand if the networks were characteristically small-world, scale free, etc..
In a second step we tried to simulate the networks obtained to try to find relevant results regarding the dynamics of networks.
